          Hi there! I'm Ezekiel Tarranza, an aspirant Full-Stack Developer,
          tech-enthusiast, and a potato!
        </h1>
        <p>
          I find developing things fun! I explore, get in awe, and learn how to
          do it. I do really love to work in groups as it is one of my forms of
          socializing, making me a very good team-player!
